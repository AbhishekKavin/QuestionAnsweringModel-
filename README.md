# QuestionAnsweringModel
Data has been collected based on some template conversation between individual and some context-based conversation. Based on
the context of the conversation I have created a Chabot or conversation-generating model that could reply to a set of starter conversation mentioned in test data.

# Data Description :
There are two files.<br>
<b>TrainData.txt</b> : contains the conversion as answer and question separated by tab.<br>
<b>TestData.csv</b> : has two columns I.D. & Question. <br>
<b>I.D.</b> ðŸ¡ª it contains the question number <br>
<b>Question</b> ðŸ¡ª it contains starter of a conversation.
